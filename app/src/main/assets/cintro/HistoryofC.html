<h1 style="text-align: center;">C History</h1>
<p>It is good to learn about the history of C programming. C was developed and written by&nbsp;<em>Dennis M. Ritchie</em>&nbsp;in the year 1972, and hence he is known as the&nbsp;<em>founder of C</em>.</p>
<p>C programming language was developed to overcome the difficulties found in older programming languages such as BCPL, BASIC, B, etc.</p>
<p>Here are the lists of programming languages that were developed with or before C:</p>

<p>&nbsp;C is imperative language and designed to compile in a relatively straightforward manner which provides low-level access to the memory. With the gradual increase in the popularity of the program, the language and its compiler have become available on a wide range of platforms from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.</p>
<p>With the introduction of K&amp;R C language (which is a new edition of C published in 1978 by Brian Kernighan and Denis Ritchie), several features have been included in C language.</p>
<p>Some of these features are:</p>
<ul style="list-style: circle;">
	<li>Standard I/O (Input/Output) Library</li>
	<li>long int - data type</li>
	<li>unsigned int - data type</li>
	<li>Compound assignment operators</li>
</ul>
<p>During the late 1980s, C was started to use for a wide variety of mainframe computers, micro and mini computers which began to get famous. Gradually C got its superset - i.e., C++ which has added features, but its developed from C with all its initial concepts.</p>
