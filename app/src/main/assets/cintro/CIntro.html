<blockquote>
    <p><strong>C is a high-level structured oriented programming language, used in general purpose programming, developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, the USA between 1969 and 1973.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <font-family:Georgia>
        <li>In&nbsp;<strong>1988</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>American National Standards Institute (ANSI)</strong>&nbsp;had formalized the C language.</li>
        <li>C was invented to write&nbsp;<strong>UNIX</strong>&nbsp;operating system.</li>
        <li>C is a successor of 'Basic Combined Programming Language' (BCPL) called&nbsp;<strong>B language.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Linux OS</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>PHP</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>MySQL</strong>&nbsp;are written in C.</li>
        <li>C has been written in assembly language.</li></font-family:Georgia>

            <h2>Uses of C Programming Language</h2>
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none;">

            <p>In the beginning, C was used for developing system applications, e.g. :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Database Systems</a></li>
                <li>Language Interpreters</li>
                <li>Compilers and Assemblers</a></li>
                <li>Operating Systems</a></li>
                <li>Network Drivers</li>
                <li>Word Processors</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ul style="list-style: disc;">
        <li>One of the early programming languages.</li>
        <li>Still, the best programming language to learn quickly.</li>
        <li>C language is reliable, simple and easy to use.</li>
        <li>C language is a structured language.</li>
        <li>Modern programming concepts are based on C.</li>
        <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.</li>
        <li>Universities preferred to add C programming in their courseware.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Features of C Programming Language</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C is a robust language with a rich set of built-in functions and operators.</li>
        <li>Programs written in C are efficient and fast.</li>
        <li>C is highly portable, programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification.</li>
        <li>C is a collection of C library functions; we can also create our function and add it to the C library.</li>
        <li>C is easily extensible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Advantages of&nbsp;C</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C is the building block for many other programming languages.</li>
        <li>Programs written in C are highly portable.</li>
        <li>Several standard functions are there (like in-built) that can be used to develop programs.</li>
        <li>C programs are collections of C library functions, and it's also easy to add own functions to the C library.</li>
        <li>The modular structure makes code debugging, maintenance and testing easier.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Disadvantages of C</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C does not provide Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.</li>
        <li>There are no concepts of Namespace in C.</li>
        <li>C&nbsp;does not provide binding or wrapping up of data in a single unit.</li>
        <li>C does not provide Constructor and Destructor.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><h2>The limitations of C programming languages are as follows:</h2>	</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Difficult to debug.</li>
    <li>C allows a lot of freedom in writing code, and that is why you can put an empty line or white space anywhere in the program.&nbsp;And because there is no fixed place to start or end the line, so it is difficult to read and understand the program.</li>
    <li>C compilers can only identify errors and are incapable of handling exceptions (run-time errors).</li>
    <li>C provides no data protection.</li>
    <li>It also doesn't feature reusability of source code extensively.</li>
    <li>It does not provide strict data type checking (for example an integer value can be passed for floating datatype).</li>
</ul>
